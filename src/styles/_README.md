- This module holds our application-level styles.

- It can include theme definition (font, colours, typography) of the app UI, and global or commonly used styles.

- Material UI’s Theme is defined here and it can have global styles also exported as a part of the theme object as shown below.

- It can then be referenced in individual components using mui’s theme object.
